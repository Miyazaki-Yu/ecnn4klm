# ecnn4klm: Equivariant Convolutional Neural Network for Kondo Lattice Model

`ecnn4klm` aims to perform fast and large-scale simulations of localized spin dynamics in the Kondo lattice model using an equivariant convolutional neural network (ECNN). For details on the ECNN model, please refer to the paper [insert reference here].

## Installation

`ecnn4klm` is based on PyTorch and e3nn. To install, you need PyTorch version 1.8 or higher. I also highly recommend running it on a GPU to maximize performance.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Miyazaki-Yu/ecnn4klm.git
```
