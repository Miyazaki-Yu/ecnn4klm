# ecnn4klm: Equivariant Convolutional Neural Network for Kondo Lattice Model
 
ecnn4klm aims to perform fast and large-scale simulations of localized spin dynamics in the Kondo lattice model using an equivariant convolutional neural network (ECNN). For details on the ECNN model, please refer to the paper [insert reference here].
